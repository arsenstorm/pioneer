## Just a couple of notes for Swetrix's UI

#### Light mode
This is okay:

> This is okay but it can be improved.

#### Dark mode
This isn't really good:

> It's not really good because it is hard to tell what section the user is 

***

I'd also suggest moving the language feature to the footer and asking the user for their language preference at signup.

If you make this change, then you can use a white button background to indicate the active section ("You" or "Dashboard").

### Some examples:

These two are much clearer for the end user!

> The code for the "You" button:
> ```html
> <a class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-white select-none font-medium text-white hover:text-indigo-50 py-2 px-3 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 hover:bg-indigo-500 rounded-md bg-white hover:bg-indigo-700 dark:bg-gray-700" href="/settings" aria-current="page">
>   You
> </a>
> ```
> 
> The code for the "Dashboard" button:
> ```html
> <a class="inline-block select-none font-medium text-white hover:text-indigo-50 py-2 px-3 dark:hover:bg-gray-700 hover:bg-indigo-500 rounded-md" href="/dashboard">
>   Dashboard
> </a>
> ```

***

The changes shouldn't be too difficult to make considering that you are using Tailwind CSS, and I'd also try to opt for a different on hover colour for the logout button (traditionally red).

Good luck and keep up the great work!
